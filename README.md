MIT 6.824 - Distributed Systems Lab 1: MapReduce- Spring 2015 

Tried to build a MapReduce library in Golang as an introduction to distributed systems.
The interface to the library and the approach to fault tolerance is similar to the one described in the original MapReduce paper

MapReduce; The Go Programming Language
    Part I:   Single Master and Worker instances Map/Reduce
    Part II:  Word count
    Part III: Distributing MapReduce jobs
    Part IV:  Handling worker failures
    
For more info link to problem statement: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-1.html.

TODO: PART IV and allow user to their custom function for phases.
