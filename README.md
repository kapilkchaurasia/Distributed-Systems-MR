MIT 6.824 - Distributed Systems Lab 1: MapReduce- Spring 2015 

Tried to build a MapReduce library in Golang as an introduction to distributed systems.
The interface to the library and the approach to fault tolerance is similar to the one described in the original MapReduce paper

- MapReduce; The Go Programming Language
    - Part I:   Single Master and Worker instances Map/Reduce
    - Part II:  Word count
    - Part III: Distributing MapReduce jobs
    - Part IV:  Handling worker failures
    
For more info link to problem statement: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/labs/lab-1.html.

TODO: PART IV and allow user to their custom function for phases.
